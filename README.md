# Next Store

A fullstack React store app where a user can browse among items with which they can buy or sell. It uses React's Next.js framework and GraphQL's Apollo framework.

User stories

* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and search for items in store.
* As an authenticated user, I can add/remove items from cart and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete items from cart that I decide I don't want anymore.
* As an authenticated user, I can use a credit card to buy items in cart.
* As an authenticated user, I can submit items I want to sell through the store.
