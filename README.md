:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:

An **e-commerce app** where a user can browse among products with which they can buy or sell. It contains a client app built in [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) using it's [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) framework and GraphQL's [**Apollo**](https://www.apollographql.com/) framework. The server app uses a [**GraphQL Yoga**](https://oss.prisma.io/content/graphql-yoga/01-overview/) server with [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/) as the database interface.

Getting Started
---------------

#### Server setup

##### Install dependencies

```bash
# ./server/
$ npm install
```

<details>
<summary><b>Create .env file</b></summary>

Create an **.env** file in the server directory which will be updated during setup. See also **./server/.env_example**.
```bash
# ./server/.env
NODE_ENV=development
APP_SECRET=my-super-secret
HOST=http://localhost
PORT=4242
DEV_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:7272
PROD_CLIENT_URL=
PROD_SERVER_URL=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_PRESET=nextstore
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=
PRISMA_DEV_ENDPOINT=
PRISMA_PROD_ENDPOINT=
PRISMA_SECRET=
PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET=
MAILTRAP_HOST=
MAILTRAP_PORT=
MAILTRAP_USER=
MAILTRAP_PASS=
POSTMARK_HOST=
POSTMARK_PORT=
POSTMARK_USER=
POSTMARK_PASS=
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Setup Cloudinary</b></summary>

1. Create or access your [**Cloudinary**](https://cloudinary.com/) account.
2. Grab your API key (**CLOUDINARY_API_KEY**) and API secret (**CLOUDINARY_SECRET**) from the [main console page](
https://cloudinary.com/console).
3. Create a [folder](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library/folders/all/) where uploads will be stored.
4. Add an [upload preset](https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload) to set the dimensions uploaded files will be transformed into. (**CLOUDINARY_PRESET**)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Setup MailTrap</b></summary>

1. Create or access your [**MailTrap**](https://mailtrap.io/) account.
2. Create a demo inbox and check the SMTP Settings page for the Host, Port, Username, and Password credentials to be used in your env file.(**MAILTRAP_HOST**, **MAILTRAP_PORT**, **MAILTRAP_USER**, **MAILTRAP_PASS**)

(Postmark setup is unnecessary for local)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Setup Stripe</b></summary>

1. Create or access your [**Stripe**](https://stripe.com/) account. (Confirm your account in your email if creating an account)
2. Click the [API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) link under the Developers tab.
3. Grab the **Publishable Key** and update **STRIPE_API_KEY** on the **client side** with this key (aka **./client/config.js**)
4. Grab the **Secret key** and update **STRIPE_SECRET** in the .env file on the **server side** (aka **./server/.env**)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Setup Prisma</b></summary>

1. Create or access your [**Prisma**](https://app.prisma.io/) account.
2. Globally install prisma then login to prisma in the terminal.

```bash
# ./server/
$ npm install -g prisma
$ prisma login
```

3. [Set up Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.26/get-started/01-setting-up-prisma-demo-server-JAVASCRIPT-a001/) by using the [prisma-cli](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) in the terminal to generate your endpoint.

```bash
# ./server/
$ prisma init
# ? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server?
> Demo server
# ? Choose the region of your demo server
# (for me it was 'answart/demo-us1')
> PRISMA-WORKSPACE/PRISMA-SERVER
# ? Choose a name for your service
> next-store-dev
# ? Choose a name for your stage (dev)
> dev
# ? Select the programming language for the generated Prisma client
> Don\'t generate
```
It will generate the files **datamodel.graphql** and **prisma.yml**.

4. Place the endpoint url from the generated **prisma.yml** as the **PRISMA_DEV_ENDPOINT** in your .env file. Delete the generated files as the endpoint is now in the .env file and generated files are already configured in the prisma directory.

5. Run the deploy script. Any changes from this point on can be deployed with the following script:

```bash
$ npm run deploy:dev
```

#### Client  setup

##### Install dependencies

```bash

Update config file variables with the environment variables set in **./server/.env** with the same name.
```bash
# ./client/config.js
# ...
export const PROD_SERVER_URL = 'PUTHERE';
export const CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 'PUTHERE';
export const CLOUDINARY_PRESET = 'PUTHERE';
export const CLOUDINARY_SECRET = 'PUTHERE';
export const STRIPE_API_KEY = 'PUBLISHABLE-KEY-FROM-STRIPE';
# ...
```

</details>

-------------

#### Start App

##### Start server app locally
```bash
# ./server/
$ npm run start:dev
```
