# You can only access the API when providing JWTs that are signed with this secret
# The secret is used to generate JTWs which allow to authenticate
# against your Prisma service. You can use the `prisma token` command from the CLI
# to generate a JWT based on the secret. When using the `prisma-binding` package,
# you don't need to generate the JWTs manually as the library is doing that for you
# (this is why you're passing it to the `Prisma` constructor).
